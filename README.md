# GÃ‰ANT Basic Python assessment questions


1. Write a method that accepts an iterable of integers
   as input and returns an iterable containing all prime
   integers.
   (cf. `part1.py` in this repository for a code reference)


2. Write a generator method that accepts an iterable of integers
   as input and, rather than pre-computing an entire 
   list before returning, yields prime values one-by-one
   as they are discovered (maybe you already did this
   in your solution to #1)
   (cf. `part2.py` in this repository for a code reference)


3. Write some methods to test one of the implementations
   you created.  If necessary, you can improve your
   original implementation based on your test results.
   (cf. `part3.py` in this repository for a code reference)
   * One method which verifies that a known test vector
     yields the expected results.
   * One method which verifies that invalid input data
     is caught and handled elegantly.
